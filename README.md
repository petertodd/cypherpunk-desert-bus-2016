# Cypherpunk Desert Bus 2016 Digital Evidence Archive

This Git repository commits to all digital evidence collected by Peter Todd
during the operation of the "Cypherpunk Desert Bus" station of the Zcash 1.0
"Sprout" trusted setup ceremony.

This repository doesn't by itself contain the files. Rather, [git-annex](https://git-annex.branchable.com/) has been used to cryptographically
commit to those files via SHA256 hash. Additionally,
[OpenTimestamps](https://opentimestamps.org) has been used to [timestamp
commits](https://petertodd.org/2016/opentimestamps-git-integration) in this
repo.

The DVD images are available [via archive.org](https://archive.org/details/cypherpunk-desert-bus-2016).
Other content will be released in the near future.
